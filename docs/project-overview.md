 # APPLICATION Y.I.K.E.S. (Yielding Intelligent Knowledge from Extraterrestrial Samples)

 ## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
Our application aims to leverage the power of transfer learning in machine learning to decode the mysteries of space biology. By utilizing a comprehensive database of publicly available biomedical datasets, our application intends to pretrain models that can then be refined using space biology datasets. The primary objective is to quickly and efficiently gain insights into unknown organisms' DNA samples by intelligently comparing them against known sequences and inferring biological pathways and functions.

 ## FINAL APPLICATION


 ## APPLICATION HIGHLIGHTS
 - **BLAST Integration:** Our application leverages the BLAST tool, which will be integrated through its API.
 - **Multi-step Analysis Framework:** An analysis pipeline that first finds similar sequences using BLAST, then identifies specific genes and proteins to infer biological pathways and functions. Saves time and resources!
 - **Space Biology Considerations:** Acknowledging the challenge of terrestrial datasets vs. alien organisms....... correlating known effects of space conditions on terrestrial organisms to potential impacts on alien organisms.
 - **Advanced Analysis Tools:** Annotation tools like Augustus and DAVID are used for later, in-depth analysis steps, enhancing the insights derived.

 ## USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
 - **Transfer Learning:** By pretraining on biomedical datasets, the machine learning models in our application encode underlying features and relationships, which can then be refined using specific space biology datasets.
 - **DNA Sequence Analysis:** AI will be crucial in quickly comparing DNA sequences and making predictions about the organism, streamlining what would otherwise be a time-consuming process.
 - **Biological Pathway Inference:** Post-sequence comparison, AI will be used to infer biological pathways and functions, offering insights into the unknown organism.

 ## SPACE AGENCY DATA
 - **Datasets Utilization:** Our application will tap into the vast reservoir of data provided by space agencies, particularly focusing on terrestrial organisms exposed to space conditions. This will aid in refining the pretrained models.
 - **NASA Open Science Data Repository:** As part of the challenge, the team will explore datasets available in the NASA Open Science Data Repository to enhance the model zoo.
